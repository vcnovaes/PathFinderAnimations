### Autonomous Agent with Search Algorithms

- This is a project for the class IF684 - Sistemas Inteligentes(Intelligent Systems) 
- The available algorithms are:
    - BFS (Breadth First Search)
    - DFS (Deepth First Search)
    - Dijkstra Algorithm 
    - Greedy Search
- You can run the software locally using Visual Studio Code extension Live Server or run `python -m http.server`
- Or you can just open our github page through this link: https://vcnovaes.github.io/PathfindingAnimations/
